Acme Corporation isn't just a few .py files. If you want to grow in your career
here, you'll have to answer the following:

What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
when others do the same for your code?

We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
improve this situation?

Answer both of these questions (baseline ~5 sentences) here in text.


1) Variable names are important to me. It makes it easier to follow the code
and might not need to read a comment explaining what its doing. Sometimes when
i forget to comment my code and i go back it sometime later. I am able to
remember what I did or was trying to do. So if somebody forgets to comment their
code but the variables are decent and self explanatory the you can get by without 
a comment needing to be included. Using vague symbols like x can get confusing
if its a long piece of code and it doesn't standout.

2)containers are great because they can isolate environments. Therefore you know
that the only things running are the things you specifically installed. They are
also great because they can run on any operating system. Therefore you do not
have to worry about code that works on a windows pc not working as intended on
a mac. It will behave the same and have the same bugs.
